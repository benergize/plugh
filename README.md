# plugh.js

Welcome to the fabulous world of plugh.js. This is a WIP text adventure game engine in development for ParserComp 2022. This is a major improvement on my old engine, JTACE and you should use this instead of that.

## What is this?

This is a text adventure engine for creating games like ADVENTURE or Zork. If you know JS, it should be very easy to pickup. All of the heavy lifting is done by the engine.

## Is this in a usable state?

Yes! But until release 0 I can't promise there won't be breaking changes/incompatibilities between commits--So if you're using the engine while it's in early development, check the update log before updating.

## Contributing

You're welcome to request features or submit PRs. I cannot promise I will get to them in a timely fashion because I have a full time job and I am working on this during lunch breaks.

## Update Log/Breaking Changes

- 2022-05-09: Initial commit. If you're already using the engine you're a wizard or a hacker or a wizard hacker.

## Missing features/in progress

- Combat mode (this was in JTACE, I don't know if anyone cares about this)
- Saving/loading
- Meaningful documentation

## Groceries

- Milk
- Grapefruit
- Bell peppers
- Yogurt
